Proximity Sensor (WIP)

Currently the proximity sensor is not fully set up. However, the CoppeliaSim scene "trash-collection.ttt" contains the work that we have so far.
This work includes a UR3 arm with a non-functional proximity sensor, as well as a laptop placed above the sensor's range. Ideally, the laptop
will fall through and generate a reading from the proximity sensor, to help demonstrate functionality. As of now, the laptop falls, and we have
a graph of how far the laptop is from the robot during this fall, but we have not yet linked this to python code.

In order to run this demo:
- Download and install CoppeliaSim if you haven't already.
- Open the "trash-collection.ttt" scene
- At the top bar click Simulation -> Start simulation
- Observe the results on the graph.
- Click Simulation -> Stop simulation
